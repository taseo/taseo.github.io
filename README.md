# Hello Earth

Welcome to the source code of my [website](https://artursipatenko.com).

It's based on Udacity's Javascript [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) and it's initial source can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume).

The page showcases some of the projects that I build when started to learn web development.

Feel free to look around.
